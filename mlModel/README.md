# NLP-HATESPEECH

#### In the new age of social media hate speech is the sore subject. Sexist and racist remark in the form of hate speech is a prevailing occurrence in Social Media. Intricacy of Natural Language construct make classifying hate speech challenging. The inconspicuousness and resilience provided by internet have made it for any user to impart in a combative way.

- This repsitory have all the files related to hate speech classification.
- "Hate Speech Classification-Project.ipynb" this have all the visualizations adn cleaaning done by me for the project.
- Text segmantion and correction was done using ekphrasis library and code is presetn in Ekphrasis named ipynb file.
- Machine learning model was created using TFIDF, Countvectorizer and TFIDF trasnformer.
- Neural Netowrk was made using LSTM and it is present in Hatespeechneuealnetworklstm.
- I got machine learning model with f1score of 89 but while validating it I got 58 percent for the data.
- When I used nerural network I got accuracy of 93 and when I used the model to predict the valdiation set, I got an accuracy of 68 percent, got a increase in 10 percent in neural network.
- In neural network overfitting was controlled using spartial1D layer.
